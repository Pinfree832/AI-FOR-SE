Ethical Reflection: Addressing Bias in Predictive Models for Resource Allocation
Potential Biases in the Dataset
- Demographic Bias

The Breast Cancer dataset lacks demographic data (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status). If the training data overrepresents certain groups (e.g., white women), the model may perform poorly for underrepresented populations (e.g., women of color), leading to inequitable prioritization.

- Labeling Bias

The "priority" labels (high/medium/low) are derived from tumor malignancy and size, which may not capture nuanced clinical needs. For example:

Younger patients might need higher priority regardless of tumor size.

Comorbidities (not in the dataset) could affect urgency.

- Measurement Bias

Features like "mean radius" may be measured differently across hospitals, skewing predictions for patients from certain regions.

- Deployment Bias

If the model is trained on data from urban hospitals, it may fail to generalize to rural areas with limited diagnostic resources.


Mitigating Bias with IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)
The AI Fairness 360 toolkit provides algorithms to detect and correct biases. Hereâ€™s how it could be applied:

1.Bias Detection
from aif360.datasets import BinaryLabelDataset
from aif360.metrics import BinaryLabelDatasetMetric

# Convert data to AIF360 format
df_aif = BinaryLabelDataset(df=df, label_names=['priority'], protected_attribute_names=['age', 'race'])

# Check disparity in outcomes by age/race
metric = BinaryLabelDatasetMetric(df_aif, unprivileged_groups=[{'race': 0}], privileged_groups=[{'race': 1}])
print("Disparate Impact Ratio:", metric.disparate_impact())

2.Bias Mitigation

Pre-processing: Use reweighting (e.g., Reweighing in AIF360) to balance underrepresented groups.

In-processing: Train models with fairness constraints (e.g., AdversarialDebiasing).

Post-processing: Adjust decision thresholds for protected groups (CalibratedEqOddsPostprocessing).

3.Fairness Metrics
from aif360.metrics import ClassificationMetric
cm = ClassificationMetric(df_aif, y_pred_aif, unprivileged_groups=[{'race': 0}])
print("Statistical Parity Difference:", cm.statistical_parity_difference())
print("Equal Opportunity Difference:", cm.equal_opportunity_difference())



Recommendations for Ethical Deployment
- Audit Data Representation

Ensure the dataset includes diverse demographics (age, race, geography).

- Dynamic Priority Adjustments

Incorporate clinician feedback to refine labels (e.g., override model priorities for edge cases).

- Transparency

Use SHAP values to explain predictions to stakeholders:
import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)

- Continuous Monitoring

Track real-world performance across subgroups to detect drift.
